# Jarvis-March
c++ jarvis march implementation

*This is not intended to be a full program which will download and compile immediately, it is the code segment I used to compute the convex hull, and therefore can be used to work with other code*

This is a segment of code I wrote this past semester to implement the Jarvis March (or gift-wrapping) algorithm.
While this algorithm is not terribly efficient, with a run time of O(nh) where n is the number of points in the set, and h is the number of points of the hull, it can be used in several applications.
